#Part 1: Introduction to Software Engineering

Explain what software engineering is and discuss its importance in the technology industry.

-Software engineering involves the process of developing, designing, testing and maintaing software applications, websites and programmes in a structured and efficient way that can be used to solve real world problems or that meet user needs and specifications.

-Software engineering plays a vital role in the technology industry in nay ways one of them being giving an opportunity for tecnological innovation, automation of processes which improves efficiency and also powering the digital economy through online services and businesses. It also ensures security and reliability providing protection of data from cyber threats while at the same time enabling seemless connectivity through the internent and communication platforms. In conclusioon, Software engineering is the backbone of modern day technology. It shapes how we communicate, work and interact with digital systems.



Identify and describe at least three key milestones in the evolution of software engineering.

-In the 1960s Structured programming was introduced which made it easier to read, write and fix code. Instead of writing one long sequence of instructions, developers started using organized structures like loops, functions, and conditional statements. This made software development more predictable and manageable, helping to reduce mistakes and improve efficiency. This milestone was crucial because it laid the foundation for modern programming techniques, making software development more structured and reliable.

-In the 1990s, the internet changed everything. Before this, most software ran on individual computers, but with the internet, developers could create websites, online services, and e-commerce platforms like Amazon and eBay. This made software more connected and accessible worldwide. At the same time the Agile methodology was introduced which focused on  small, fast updates, teamwork, and adapting to customer feedback instead of following a fixed, step-by-step process. This made software development much more flexible and efficient.

-In the 2010s, There were 3 major advancements in software egineering the first being artificial intelligence. AI became a big part of software, helping with automation, data analysis, and even writing code. AI-powered assistants like Siri and Google Assistant became common. Second was DevOps (Development and Operations). It was introduced to make software development and deployment faster and smoother. Instead of developers writing code and waiting for a separate IT team to deploy it, DevOps combined both tasks, using automation to speed up the process. Thirdly was Mobile deveoplment which came about from the rise of smartphones. Instead of just making software for computers, developers focused on creating mobile apps for iOS and Android, changing the way people use technology.



List and briefly explain the phases of the Software Development Life Cycle.

Planning – Involves defining project goals, estimating costs, and assessing feasibility to ensure a clear direction.

Requirements Gathering & Analysis – Identifing and documenting what the software must do, including user needs and system constraints.

Design – Creating the system architecture, UI designs, and technical specifications for how the software will function.

Development (Coding & Implementation) – Writing the actual code using programming languages and frameworks to build the software.

Testing – Checking for bugs, security issues, and performance problems to ensure the software works as expected.

Deployment – Release of the software to users, either as a full launch or in phases, making it accessible for real-world use.

Maintenance & Updates – Fixing bugs, improving performance, and adding new features to keep the software functional and up to date.




Compare and contrast the Waterfall and Agile methodologies. Provide examples of scenarios where each would be appropriate.

-Waterfall is rigid and best suited for projects with well-defined and unchanging requirements, such as government contracts or large infrastructure projects like hospital management systems. Agile, on the other hand, is highly adaptable, making it ideal for projects where requirements frequently change, such as mobile applications, e-commerce platforms, or SaaS products.

-Testing in Waterfall is typically done only after development is completed, which can lead to costly fixes if major issues are found late in the process. Agile, however, incorporates continuous testing and iteration, reducing risks and allowing for quicker adjustments. This makes Agile preferable for projects like AI-driven tools or web applications, where updates need to be deployed frequently.

-The Waterfall methodology follows a linear and sequential approach, where each phase (planning, design, development, testing, and deployment) is completed before moving to the next. In contrast, the Agile methodology is iterative and flexible, allowing for continuous development, testing, and feedback throughout the project.

Describe the roles and responsibilities of a Software Developer, a Quality Assurance Engineer, and a Project Manager in a software engineering team.

-A Software Developer designs, writes, and maintains software applications. They develop clean, efficient code based on project requirements and work closely with designers, testers, and project managers. Their responsibilities include fixing bugs, optimizing performance, and staying updated with new technologies. For example, a developer may code a new login feature for a mobile app.

-A Quality Assuarance Engineer ensures software quality by designing and running tests to identify and report bugs. They use manual and automated testing to verify functionality, security, and performance. Their role helps prevent defects before release. For instance, a Quality Assuarance engineer testing an e-commerce app ensures the checkout process works correctly.

-A Project Manager oversees the software development process, ensuring the project is completed on time and within budget. They coordinate tasks, assign responsibilities, and communicate with team members and stakeholders. For example, a project manager ensures a banking software update is delivered on schedule.




Discuss the importance of Integrated Development Environments (IDEs) and Version Control Systems (VCS) in the software development process. Give examples of each.

-Integrated Development Environments (IDEs) enhance coding efficiency by providing essential tools like auto-completion, syntax highlighting, built-in debugging and seamless integration with frameworks which help developers write, test, and debug code faster while reducing errors. Some examples include Visual Studio Code, IntelliJ IDEA, and PyCharm, each offering specialized features for different programming languages.

-Version Control Systems (VCS) play a crucial role in software development by tracking changes in code, enabling multiple developers to collaborate without conflicts, maintaining different versions of a project, and allowing rollbacks when needed, ensuring a structured and organized workflow. Some examples include Git (widely used with platforms like GitHub and GitLab), Apache Subversion (SVN) (commonly used in enterprise environments), and Mercurial (known for its simplicity and efficiency in managing distributed projects).



What are some common challenges faced by software engineers? Provide strategies to overcome these challenges.

-Debugging and Fixing Bugs: Identifying and resolving issues in code can be time-consuming.
Solution: Using debugging tools, writing unit tests, and adopting test-driven development (TDD) to catch bugs early.

-Meeting Deadlines and Managing Workload: Tight schedules and multiple tasks can lead to stress and burnout.
Solution: Using project management tools like Jira or Trello, breaking tasks into smaller milestones, and following Agile methodologies to stay on track.

-Balancing Performance and Functionality: Optimizing software performance while maintaining all required features can be challenging.
Solution: Using efficient algorithms, conducting performance testing, and optimizing database queries to improve speed and scalability.

-Handling Security and Data Privacy: Software must be protected from cyber threats and vulnerabilities.
Solution: Following secure coding practices, conducting regular security audits, and staying updated with cybersecurity best practices



Explain the different types of testing (unit, integration, system, and acceptance) and their importance in software quality assurance.

-Unit Testing ensures individual components or functions work correctly in isolation by catching bugs early and improving code reliability. It helps developers identify errors in small sections of code before they affect the entire system, reducing debugging time and ensuring that each unit functions as expected before integration.

-Integration Testing checks if different modules or components work together properly by identifying issues in data flow between system parts, such as APIs and databases. It ensures that all integrated components communicate correctly, preventing errors caused by data mismatches, broken connections, or unexpected interactions between different parts of the system.

-System Testing validates the complete and fully integrated software system by ensuring it functions correctly under real-world conditions and meets all functional and non-functional requirements. It assesses the system’s overall performance, security, and usability, ensuring that all components work seamlessly together before deployment.

-Acceptance Testing verifies if the software meets business requirements and user expectations before deployment, ensuring it is ready for real-world use. It provides final validation by simulating actual user scenarios, confirming that the software aligns with stakeholder needs, regulatory standards, and business goals before being released to the public.

#Part 2: Introduction to AI and Prompt Engineering


Define prompt engineering and discuss its importance in interacting with AI models.

-Prompt engineering is the process of carefully designing and structuring input prompts to optimize the responses generated by AI models. It involves selecting the right wording, context, and format to guide the AI in producing accurate, relevant, and high-quality outputs.

-Prompt engineering is important because it helps AI generate more accurate and relevant responses by reducing ambiguity and improving efficiency by enabling quicker understanding of user intent. It allows for customization to suit specific tasks which minimizes misinterpretation by ensuring clarity in communication, and enhances productivity by making AI a powerful tool for automation, research, and problem-solving.


Provide an example of a vague prompt and then improve it by making it clear, specific, and concise. Explain why the improved prompt is more effective.

An example of a Vague Prompt:
"Tell me about technology."

The improved Prompt can be:
"Explain the impact of artificial intelligence on medical diagnostics."

How the Prompt is Improved:
The original vague prompt, "Tell me about technology," was too broad, lacking direction on which area of technology to focus on. The improved prompt is more effective because it:

Narrows the topic down – It focuses on artificial intelligence instead of general technology.
Defines the context – It specifies medical diagnostics, making the response more relevant.
Clarifies the request – It asks for an explanation of the impact, guiding the AI to provide meaningful insights.
